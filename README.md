## Quick Introduction

### KeyBinds:
- move and strafe: W, A, S, D
- turn: Left and Right Arrows
- shoot: Space
- interact: E

### Startup:
When the game (hopefully) starts, you're greeted with 2 windows. The windows are both a different kind of visual representation of the game world.
The one you're supposed to look at while playing the game is ofcourse the 3d view. If you try looking around, you may notice that you're in a small room, and there is a small hole in the wall next to you. Try interacting with the shadowy figure poking from the wall.

### Now the fun part:
After speaking with him, you'll notice that you're able to open the door. But watch out! You may be greeted with multiple enemies.
There are atleast 4 (semi)randomly placed spawners scattered around the map. These spawners activate when they see you, and instantly start spawning enemies, so be quick.
After all of these are destroyed, You'll notice that something has appeared in the middle of the map.

After defeating the last enemy, you can go back to where you started, and talk to the wall again.

GOOD JOB! You finished the game :D
